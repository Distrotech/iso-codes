# Code for formerly used names of countries
#
# Status: ISO 3166-3:1999 + newsletters (latest dated 2002-05-20)
# Last update: 2002-11-12
#
# The ISO 3166 code for names of countries was first published in 1974. 
# In 1981 a Numeric code was added to the existing Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 codes.
# The Numeric code identifies a physical territory while the Alpha-2 and
# Alpha-3 codes identify a country name.
# There were new editions of the ISO 3166 standard in 1981, 1988 and 1993.
# The fifth and latest edition of the country code is ISO 3166-1:1997.
# The ISO 3166-3 Code for formerly used names of countries was first
# published in 1999.
#
# An entry from the ISO 3166-1 country code table may be withdrawn if
# - a country changes a significant part of its name
# - a country is divided into two or more new ones
# - two or more countries merge
# Codes withdrawn from use may not be reused for five years.
#
# The following ISO 3166-3 table has five tab-separated columns:
# 1. Alpha-4 code (consisting of the former and the new Alpha-2 codes)
# 2. Alpha-3 code
# 3. Numeric code
# 4. Date of withdrawal or change (YYYY-MM-DD)
# 5. Country name
#
# The Alpha-4 code in the first column consists of the Alpha-2 code of the
# withdrawn entry followed by the Alpha-2 code of the new entry.
#
# If there is no single new entry which replaces the withdrawn entry,
# the letters 'HH' will be appended to the withdrawn Alpha-2 code.
#
# If the Alpha-2 code is unchanged (i.e. only the Numeric code or the 
# Alpha-3 code changed), the Alpha-2 code without any appended letters 
# will be shown in column 1.
