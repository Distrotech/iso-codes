This package aims to provide the list of the country, language,
language scripts and currency names in one place, rather than repeated
in many programs throughout the system.

Currently there are lists of languages and countries embedded in:

- Gnome Libs
- bootfloppies / PGI
- KDE
- Gnumeric
- Gnucash
- ...

This leads to about a dozen lists of 200 languages, translated
into >30 languages ... not very efficient. The aim of this patch
is to create a single "gettext" domain "iso-639" which contains
the translations of language names, and one "iso-3166" listing
the translations of country  names.

So the plan is then to be able to use
	dgettext("iso-639", language_name)
to get the correct translations.

The files
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_639.xml
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_639_3.xml
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_4217.xml
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_3166.xml
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_15924.xml
/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_3166_2.tab

store the files in simple XML format.

The files

ISO-3166
--------

This lists the 2-letter country code and "short" country name. The
official IS0-3166 maintenance agency is ISO:
http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes

ISO-639
-------
This lists the 2-letter and 3-letter language codes and language
names. The official IS0-639 maintenance agency is the Library of
Congress: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/

ISO-639-3
---------
This is a DRAFT extension to the ISO-639 standard. The proponent is
SIL International: http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/

ISO_4217
--------
This lists the currency codes and names. The official IS0-4217
maintenance agency is the British Standards Institution:
http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Standards-and-Publications/Industry-Sectors/Services/BSI-Currency-Code-Service/


ISO_15924
--------
This lists the language scripts names. The official IS0-15924
maintenance agency is the Unicode Consortium:
http://unicode.org/iso15924/


ISO 3166_2
-----------
The ISO 3166 standard includes a "Country Subdivision Code",
giving a code for the names of the principal administrative
subdivisions of the countries coded in ISO 3166.

ISO 3166-2 is a set of files giving this ISO 3166-2 standard:
(available at http://www.din.de/gremein/nabd/iso3166ma/a3ptnorm.html)
this is a standard that gives short codes for provinces,
etc. within a country. As these also list the provinces, Counties,
etc. within a country, they could also be used to provide a
drop-down list when someone is entering addresses...

DEVELOPING USING PKGCONFIG
--------------------------

A pkgconfig file has been included to aid developing with this package.
You can detect the prefix where the translations have been placed using

$ pkg-config --variable=prefix iso-codes
/usr

You can detect which sets of translation (domain) files have been installed using
$ pkg-config --variable=domains iso-codes
iso-639 iso-3166 iso-4217 iso-3166-1 iso-3166-2 iso-3166-3 iso-15924
