iso-codes
=========
<http://pkg-isocodes.alioth.debian.org/>

This package provides lists of various ISO standards (e.g. country,
language, language scripts, and currency names) in one place, rather
than repeated in many programs throughout the system.

Currently there are lists of languages and countries embedded in
several different programs, which leads to dozens of lists of
200 languages, translated into more than 30 languages ... not
very efficient.

With this package, we create a single "gettext domain" for every
supported ISO standard which contains the translations of
that domain. It is easy for a programmer to re-use those
translations instead of maintaining their own translation
infrastructure. Moreover, the programmer does not need to follow
changes in the ISO standard and will not work with outdated
information.

To use this translation infrastructure, the programmer just needs
to call dgettext() in their program.

Example:
    dgettext("iso_639", "French")
will return the translation for "French", depending on the
current locale.

Furthermore, this package provides the ISO standards as XML files
to be used by other applications as well. All those XML files
are stored in the directory "/usr/share/xml/iso-codes".


ISO 3166
========

This lists the 2-letter country code and "short" country name. The
official ISO 3166 maintenance agency is ISO. The gettext domain is
"iso_3166".
<http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes>


ISO 639
=======

This lists the 2-letter and 3-letter language codes and language
names. The official ISO 639 maintenance agency is the Library of
Congress. The gettext domain is "iso_639".
<http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/>


ISO 639-3
=========

This is a further development of ISO 639-2, see above. All codes
of ISO 639-2 are included in ISO 639-3. ISO 639-3 attempts to
provide as complete an enumeration of languages as possible,
including living, extinct, ancient, and constructed languages,
whether major or minor, written or unwritten. We're currently
in the progress of merging ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3. The gettext
domain is "iso_639_3". The official ISO 639-3 maintenance agency
is SIL International.
<http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/>


ISO 4217
========

This lists the currency codes and names. The official ISO 4217
maintenance agency is the British Standards Institution. The
gettext domain is "iso_4217".

ISO 15924
=========

This lists the language scripts names. The official ISO 15924
maintenance agency is the Unicode Consortium. The gettext
domain is "iso_15924".
<http://unicode.org/iso15924/>


ISO 3166-2
==========

The ISO 3166 standard includes a "Country Subdivision Code",
giving a code for the names of the principal administrative
subdivisions of the countries coded in ISO 3166. The official
ISO 3166-2 maintenance agency is ISO. The gettext domain is
"iso_3166_2".

Adding or updating translations
===============================

The preferred way to send in a translation is using the Translation
Project (TP). You can find more information about it on their
website:

Developing using pkgconfig
==========================

A pkgconfig file has been included to aid developing with this
package. You can detect the prefix where the translations have
been placed using

$ pkg-config --variable=prefix iso-codes
/usr

You can detect which gettext domains have been installed using
$ pkg-config --variable=domains iso-codes
iso_15924 iso_3166 iso_4217 iso_639 iso_3166_2 iso_639_3
