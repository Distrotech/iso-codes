How to release a new version of iso-codes
=========================================

Make sure you have all the latest updates and no stale files
in your working copy. The best way to achieve this is to get
a fresh checkout from the SVN server.
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ svn co svn+ssh://<yourname>@svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-isocodes/trunk/iso-codes

Copy the Debian/changelog contents to ChangeLog and commit
(this step will probably change in the future).
$ svn ci ChangeLog

Update the version number in configure.ac and commit.
$ svn ci configure.ac

Update all automatically generated files (configure, Makefiles, etc.).
$ autoreconf --install --symlink

Create a tag for the next release.
$ svn copy \
  svn+ssh://<yourname>@svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-isocodes/trunk \
  svn+ssh://<yourname>@svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-isocodes/tags/version_0_XX

Create the Makefiles.
$ ./configure

Use the Makefile target "release" for creating signed tarballs.
$ make release

Upload the tarballs and your signatures to the FTP area of Alioth.
$ ALIOTH_USERNAME=<yourname> make upload

Optionally, remove previous versions from the FTP area of Alioth.

You can now clean up.
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf release/
